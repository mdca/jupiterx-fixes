# Jupiter X Customizer Typography Fixes

The Jupiter X WordPress theme has a little flaw - chages of headline (H1 - H6) line height are shown neither in Customizer nor on frontend. This is due to the ```.elementor-heading-title``` ```line-height``` definition within Elementor CSS and Jupiter X does not override this. So I made this little plugin to fix it.

## Getting Started

Download the repo as ZIP or clone it.

### Prerequisites

```
WordPress
Jupiter X theme
```

### Installing into WordPress

Just upload the plugin as a ZIP file from WP backend of upload it via FTP into the ```wp-content/plugins/jupiterx-fixes``` folder as usual.
